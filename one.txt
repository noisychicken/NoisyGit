Hello and welcome to our presentation.

Our team is called - "talk to git git talk to us."

We worked *very* hard on this and hope you enjoy it.

Some of our features may seem superfluous - please bear with us!

Before we start - a big thanks to Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris and Chris for organising this hack-day!

Over to Peter!
